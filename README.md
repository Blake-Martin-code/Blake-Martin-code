# Blake Martin - ML/AI Engineer and Agentic Engineer

Welcome to my github. I am a ML/AI Engineer with 4+ years of experience. I specialize in building and deploying Agentic Systems to classified environments. On the side I build many ai applications, most of which are private repos.

## Open Source Projects

### (Companion)[https://github.com/Blake-Martin-code/companion]

**Companion** is an advanced AI agent system designed to assist with deep research, analysis, and report writing. It operates as a persistent companion that learns and stores information using a structured file system.

The purpose of **Companion** is to bridge the gap between the industry standard "Chat Bots" and the "Overkill Deep Researchers" that often acompany them. 

**Companion** meets in the middle. Allowing a user to do deeper controlled research, whilst maintaining a collection of source information found. **Companion** offers the ability to spin up parallel or sequential agents to research and write.

#### Contribute

Feel free to pull and help improve **Companion**. Currently it is fully written in python utilizing langchain and deepagents. 

##### Areas for Improvement

1. Utilize langchains `create_agent` and `middleware` instead of relying on `create_deep_agents` from `deepagents`
2. Pydantic Type and modularize the system to be more extensible
3. Improve CLI. I have mostly vibecoded the UI and would love to take it to the next level
4. Create a beautiful UI
5. Dockerize
